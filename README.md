# swiss-cheese
ðŸ§€ðŸ§€ A demo repository of small OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Like swiss-cheese, this code is full of holes. Goes great with Github Advanced Security ðŸ§€ðŸ§€

There are plenty of demo web apps with vulnerabities, this is mean to to provide smaller interactive demonstrations so students can problem specific vulnerabities atomically.

# Purpose

The code samples here here several a couple of main purposes:

## Understanding of Secure Coding Practices

1. Show specific hands on examples of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with small "working" code samples.
2. Demonstrate a specific vulnerability and discuss how a code review might have prevented it. 
3. Practice fixing vulnerabilities.
4. Basic understanding of SAST tooling. Specifically using features in Github Advanced Security.
5. Using an AI coding assistant such as Github Copilot to ask question about code and what security weaknesses may exist. Additionally, AI coding assistants can provide targeted recommendations for fixes. We can also experiment with threat modeling methodologies such as STRIDE and PASTA.

## Github Advanced Security Exercises

This repository is also used as a training exercise for Github Advanced Security (GHAS) features. See [GHAS Exercises](./doc/ghas-exercises.md) for more details.

In short, you can fork this repository and practice enabling and tuning GHAS features on known vulnerable code and dependencies.

# Code Authors

Unless otherwise sited in the code, the scripts herein are generated by a combination of Tim Kelly (human) and AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Github Copilot).  

* The supply-chain example is based on source from https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc
* The IaC Terraform misconfiguration is from https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec

# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies for the project:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:austimkelly/swiss-cheese.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd swiss-cheese`

3. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

4. Navigate to the directory for the demo you want to run and run the python file there (e.g. `$cd idor` then `$python3 idor.py`):

<<<<<<< develop
* [idor](./idor/) - Demonstrates broken access control for easily guessable IDs and no authentication. See also [OWASP IDOR](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-ghana/assets/slides/IDOR.pdf).
* [sqli](./sqli/) - Dmonstrates standard SQL Injection being able to dump a database from a form field. See also [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).
* [ssrf](./ssrf/) - Demonstrate a server side request forgery tricking the app to making a call to an not allowed 3rd party domain. See also [OWASP Server Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).
* [xss](./xss/) - Demonstrates executing arbitraty javascript inside the applicaiton. See also [OWASP Cross Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)
* [secrets](./secrets/) - An example of leaking a secrets file or environment variable configuration. These should all be caught by [Github Secrets Push Protection](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations).

# References to other Pythoh vulnerable web apps

* [Pygoat](https://github.com/austimkelly/pygoat - This is a fork of an intentionally vulnerable web app built with Django and Python. The fork enables Github Advanced security (GHAS) features: CodeQL, Secrets Scanning & Dependabot.
* [Damn Vulnerable Python Web App](https://github.com/austimkelly/dvpwa) - This is also a fork with GHAS enabled.
